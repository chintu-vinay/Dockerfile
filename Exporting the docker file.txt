# To export (OR) run the same code in other's desktop you need to follow these steps
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Command is :-

Syntax :-

docker save -o (New file name for taring the required file).tar (File name that you want to tar)


docker save -o my_python_web_scraper.tar python-webscraper

1) After taring the file, you want to copy the tared file in the other's desktop.

2) Next we want to load the tared file by entering the following command in the VScode terminal.

The Command is :- 

Syntax :- 

docker load -i (The tared file name).tar



docker load -i my_python_web_scraper.tar


3) Next run the Docker image 

Command is :-

Syntax :-

docker run -it (The original file name before you tared.)


docker run -it python-webscraper


4) Next you want to access the HTML file in the docker container in local host.

	// Command is present in the Running the docker process file

				(OR)

5) You can access the file without typing the additional command this can remove the step-4 and we can achieve this in the docker run statement itself.

The Command is :-

Syntax :-

docker run -it -v "(Path to paste in your local machine/(file name.html)):/usr/src/app/(file name.html)" python-web-scraper


docker run -it -v "C:/path/to/your/local/output:/usr/src/app/output" python-web-scraper
